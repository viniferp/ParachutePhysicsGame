<h1>Free Fall Simulator</h1>

Welcome to the Free Fall Simulator, a physics project developed for a physics class during my graduation. This project aims to simulate the concept of free fall and challenge the player to make strategic decisions to ensure a safe landing.

<h2>Game Overview</h2>

In this game, you'll be competing against a computer-controlled character in a race to the ground. Both characters start at a certain height and begin to fall when the game starts. The objective is to choose the best height to open the parachute and ensure a safe landing without any injuries.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

   Unity Engine: Unity is a powerful game development engine that provides a wide range of tools and features for creating immersive games. 
   The Free Fall Simulator was developed using Unity to leverage its physics engine and visual capabilities. ðŸŽ®ðŸ”§
   
   C# Language: C# is a versatile and object-oriented programming language that is widely used in game development. It was the primary language used to script the gameplay mechanics, physics calculations, and user interactions in the Free Fall Simulator. ðŸ’»ðŸ”¤

<h2>How to Play</h2>

   1 - Choose the initial height from which you want to start the free fall.
   
   2 - Once the game starts, both characters will begin to fall at an accelerating rate due to gravity.
  
   3 - Pay attention to the information displayed on the screen, including the current height, velocity, and acceleration.
    
   4 - Estimate the best moment to open your parachute by considering the current parameters and your knowledge of physics.
   
   5 - Use the provided controls to open the parachute when you think it's the right time.
    
   6 - The computer-controlled character will also make its own calculations and open the parachute accordingly.
   
   7 - Both characters will continue their descent with the parachutes, gradually reducing their speeds.
   
   8 - The winner is the one who lands first on the ground without sustaining any injuries.

<h2>Game Features</h2>

   - Realistic physics simulation: The game accurately calculates and displays the effects of gravity, free fall speed, acceleration, and parachute deployment.
    
   - Interactive gameplay: You can actively participate in the game by selecting the height at which you want to start your free fall and deciding when to open your parachute.
   
   - Informative display: The screen provides constant updates on your current height, velocity, acceleration, as well as the computer-controlled character's data.
    
   - Challenging competition: Compete against an AI-controlled character to test your understanding of free fall and make strategic decisions for a successful landing.
   
   - Educational purpose: This project was developed as part of a physics class, and it aims to enhance your understanding of physics concepts through an engaging game.
